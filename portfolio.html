<h1>Throwback Collage</h1>

<p>In my first digital studies class, Art 107, we were assigned to create a throwback collage. This project was the first assignment that I truly enjoyed! We were asked to layer multiple pictures, so I used a photo I took of my sister dancing and duplicated it, a picture I took in Italy on a family trip for the background, and a cover photo of one of my favorite bands: Glass Animals, for a flower effect. I am grateful for this class because it is the reason I decided to pursue a digital studies major! </p>


<h1>Poster Project</h1>

<p>This piece was created in CA 155 for an assignment called the Poster Project. We were asked to create a poster for a TV show that would have a very specific audience through photoshop. My idea was to do a spin-off show of the Bachelor and instead do a college version entitled Date Party. Being in a sorority, we put on a few events throughout the year and date party is one of our most fun events. That being said, every time we have a date party we are allowed to invite someone to be our date. I thought it would be funny to do a date party themed show where contestants would get roses and the ultimate winner would get to attend date party with me. I had a very clear target audience of college students, and in particular bachelor/bachelorette fans. This piece is still one of my favorites and I really enjoyed the projects we did in this class. </p>
